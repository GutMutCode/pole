## 🔧 Technical Innovations

### 1. Scancode Keyboard Support
**Problem:** WASD doesn't work on Korean keyboard  
**Solution:** Use physical key position (scancode) instead of keycode

```pole-ir
// Before (keycode - layout dependent)
let keycode = pole_read_i32_at(event, 24)
if keycode == 119 then // W key

// After (scancode - layout independent)
let scancode = pole_read_i32_at(event, 16)
if scancode == 26 then // W key position
```

**Result:** Works on any keyboard layout! 🌍

### 2. Modulo Without % Operator
**Problem:** `%` operator not implemented in compiler  
**Solution:** Manual modulo using division

```pole-ir
func should_move_zombie(frame_count: Int) -> Bool:
  let divided = frame_count / 30 in
  let remainder = frame_count - (divided * 30) in
  remainder == 0
```

**Result:** Zombie moves every 30 frames

### 3. C Struct Interop
**Problem:** Can't pass Pole records to C functions  
**Solution:** Malloc + manual field writes

```pole-ir
func create_rect(x, y, w, h) -> Ptr<Unit>:
  let rect = malloc(16) in
  let _ = pole_write_i32_at(rect, 0, x) in
  let _ = pole_write_i32_at(rect, 4, y) in
  let _ = pole_write_i32_at(rect, 8, w) in
  let _ = pole_write_i32_at(rect, 12, h) in
  rect
```

**Result:** Perfect SDL2 FFI integration

### 4. Color-Coded Health System
**Problem:** Show health status at a glance  
**Solution:** Conditional color selection

```pole-ir
let color = if health > 50 then 0 
            else if health > 20 then 1 
            else 2
let r = if color == 0 then 0 else 255
let g = if color == 0 then 200 else if color == 1 then 165 else 0
```

**Result:** Green → Orange → Red visual feedback

## 🎯 Development Insights

### What Worked Well

**1. Incremental Development**
- Day 1: Just compile and show window
- Day 2: Add visuals and input
- Day 3: Add gameplay and polish
- **Result:** Steady progress, no blockers

**2. Simple Solutions First**
- Printf for game over (not SDL_ttf)
- Rectangles for health bar (not textures)
- Manual modulo (not implementing %)
- **Result:** Fast iteration, working game

**3. Test-Driven Fixes**
- Found Korean keyboard issue by testing
- Fixed with scancode immediately
- **Result:** Universal keyboard support

**4. Performance by Default**
- Native compilation = 60 FPS
- No optimization needed
- Small binary (24 KB)
- **Result:** Smooth gameplay

### Challenges Overcome

**1. Float64 Parser Bug**
- **Issue:** `1.0` parsed as `1` + `.0` garbage
- **Fix:** Try float before int in parser
- **Lesson:** Order matters in parsers

**2. Unit Argument Mismatch**
- **Issue:** `f()` → `f(Unit)` but function expects 0 args
- **Fix:** Skip Unit arg for 0-param functions
- **Lesson:** Currying vs C calling conventions

**3. Korean Keyboard**
- **Issue:** WASD = ㅈㅁㄴㅇ but different keycodes
- **Fix:** Use scancode (physical position)
- **Lesson:** Physical keys > logical keys for games

**4. No Modulo Operator**
- **Issue:** `%` not in compiler
- **Fix:** `n - (n/d)*d` = modulo
- **Lesson:** Don't block on missing features
